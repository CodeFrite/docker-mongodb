# MongoDB in Docker

In this guide, we will learn how to:

- create a Docker container with MongoDB installed
- connect to the MongoDB container from the shell
- connect to the MongoDB from different programming languages: Node.js, TypeScript, Go, Java & Python
- create a database and a collection
- insert and query data
- stop and remove the MongoDB container
- create a reusable Docker image with all the tools, configurations and data we need

# Step 1: Installing Docker Desktop

In order to manage Docker containers on your machine, you can either use the Docker CLI or the Docker Desktop application. For this guide, we will first use the Docker Desktop application which is more intuitive and user-friendly. After, we will use Docker compose to manage the image using a configuration file. But first things first, let's install Docker Desktop, create and use our first container.

Head to the [Docker page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), and inside `Products` click on `Docker Desktop`. You will be redirected to the download page.

Choose the version that fits your operating system and click on the download button:

After the download is complete, install Docker Desktop on your machine and run it. You should be welcomed by the Docker Desktop dashboard:

# Step 2: Getting a MongoDB Image

Now that we have Docker Desktop installed, we can start creating our MongoDB container. First, we need to get the MongoDB image from the Docker Hub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
docker pull mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

You should now see it appear in the images list:

![mongodb-image](./images/mongodb-image.png)

Alternatively, you can search for the MongoDB image in the Docker Desktop dashboard and click `Pull` (the search bar is located at the top of the dashboard):

![docker search bar](./images/docker-search-bar.png)

# Step 3: Running the MongoDB Image

Now that we have the MongoDB image, we can create a container from it. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

You should see the container appear in the container list:

![mongodb running container](./images/mongodb-container.png)

You can also type the following command to list all the running docker containers:

```bash
% docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                      NAMES
3b3d10964fe1   mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest   "python3 /usr/local/â€¦"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes   0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp   mongodb
```

Alternatively, you can run an image from the Docker Desktop dashboard. Click on `Run` next to the MongoDB image and select the different options:

![run image from docker desktoo](./images/run-mongodb-from-docker-desktop.png)

# Step 4: Connecting to the MongoDB Container

Now that we have the MongoDB container running, we can connect to it from the shell using `mongosh`. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mongosh --port 27017
Current Mongosh Log ID: 67dfdc06686335afb13b1bb0
Connecting to:          mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+2.3.8
Using MongoDB:          7.0.17
Using Mongosh:          2.3.8
mongosh 2.4.2 is available for download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

For mongosh info see: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/

test>
```

You are now connected to the MongoDB container. You can run the following command to list all the databases:

```bash
test> show dbs
admin   40.00 KiB
config  12.00 KiB
local   40.00 KiB
```

Most of the information in this section can be found [in this guide on mongodb website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-community-with-docker/).

# Step 5: Creating a new Database, inserting and querying data

Before going any further and learn how to connect to the MongoDB container from different programming languages, let's create a new database, a new collection, insert some data and query it.

First, let's create a new database called `dictionary` which will contain a collection called `wordDefs` of words and their definitions in a given language. Run the following commands in the `mongosh` shell:

```bash
test> use dictionary
```

This first command switches to the `dictionary` database. At this point, the database is not yet created, but it will be created as soon as you insert data into it.

Now, let's insert some data into the `wordDefs` collection:

```bash
dictionary> db.dictionary.insertOne({ word: "hello", definition: "used as a greeting or to begin a conversation" })
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId('67dff28a26255525725c8c01')
}

dictionary> db.dictionary.insertOne({ word: "world", definition: "the earth, together with all of its countries and peoples" })
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId('67dff2a126255525725c8c02')
}
```

Now we can query all the data we just inserted:

```bash
dictionary> db.dictionary.find().toArray()
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('67dff28a26255525725c8c01'),
    word: 'hello',
    definition: 'used as a greeting or to begin a conversation'
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('67dff2a126255525725c8c02'),
    word: 'world',
    definition: 'the earth, together with all of its countries and peoples'
  }
]
```

We can also query a specific word:

```bash
dictionary> db.dictionary.findOne({ word: "hello" })
{
  _id: ObjectId('67dff28a26255525725c8c01'),
  word: 'hello',
  definition: 'used as a greeting or to begin a conversation'
}
```
